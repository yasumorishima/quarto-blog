## Introduction

I've published a Kaggle dataset that tracks the year-over-year evolution of MLB pitchers' arsenals from 2020 to 2025. This dataset enables analysis of how pitchers adjust their pitch mix, velocity, and spin rates over time.

**Dataset Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasunorim/mlb-pitcher-arsenal-2020-2025

## Dataset Overview

This dataset provides pitch-by-pitch aggregated metrics for MLB pitchers across six seasons (2020-2025).

### Basic Information

- **Period**: 2020-2025 seasons (6 seasons)
- **Rows**: 4,253 rows (pitcher × season combinations)
- **Columns**: 111 columns
- **Format**: Wide format (1 row = 1 pitcher × 1 season)
- **Filter**: Only pitchers with 100+ pitches in a season
- **Quality Score**: 10.0/10 on Kaggle

### Data Source

Data is sourced from MLB Advanced Media (Statcast) via the [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) library and aggregated by pitcher × season × pitch type.

---

## Data Structure

### Identifier Columns (3 columns)

- `player_id`: MLB player ID
- `player_name`: Player name
- `season`: Season year (2020-2025)

### Pitch Metrics (18 pitch types × 6 metrics = 108 columns)

For each pitch type, the dataset includes 6 metrics:

1. **usage_pct**: Usage rate (0-100%)
2. **avg_speed**: Average velocity (mph)
3. **avg_spin**: Average spin rate (rpm)
4. **whiff_rate**: Whiff rate (0-1)
5. **avg_pfx_x**: Average horizontal movement (inches, gravity-adjusted)
6. **avg_pfx_z**: Average vertical movement (inches, gravity-adjusted)

### Pitch Types (18 types)

FF (Four-seam), SI (Sinker), FC (Cutter), SL (Slider), CU (Curve), CH (Changeup), FS (Splitter), KC (Knuckle Curve), FO (Forkball), EP (Eephus), KN (Knuckleball), ST (Sweeper), SV (Slurve), and more.

## Usage

### Downloading the Data

Download the CSV directly from Kaggle:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Download via Kaggle API
!kaggle datasets download -d yasunorim/mlb-pitcher-arsenal-2020-2025

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('pitcher_arsenal_evolution_2020_2025.csv')
```

### Analysis Notebook

A comprehensive analysis notebook is also available:

https://www.kaggle.com/code/yasunorim/pitcher-arsenal-analysis

The notebook includes:

- Individual pitcher arsenal trend analysis
- MLB-wide pitch type trends (2020-2025)
- Velocity change analysis
- Correlation heatmaps

## Use Cases

### 1. Pitcher Arsenal Trend Analysis

Track year-over-year changes in a specific pitcher's repertoire:

```python
# Yusei Kikuchi's pitch usage evolution
kikuchi = df[df['player_name'].str.contains('Kikuchi', case=False)]
kikuchi.plot(x='season', y=['SL_usage_pct', 'FF_usage_pct', 'CH_usage_pct'])
```

For Kikuchi, slider usage increased from ~20% in 2019 to over 40% in 2022-2025, showing a significant shift in pitch mix strategy.

### 2. Injury Recovery Analysis

Analyze changes in pitch mix and velocity before and after injury:

```python
# Compare two seasons for a specific pitcher
pitcher_data = df[df['player_id'] == 123456]
pitcher_data[['season', 'FF_avg_speed', 'FF_usage_pct']]
```

### 3. MLB-Wide Trend Analysis

Visualize league-wide pitch type trends:

```python
# Calculate yearly average usage rates
yearly_avg = df.groupby('season')[['FF_usage_pct', 'SI_usage_pct', 'SL_usage_pct']].mean()
yearly_avg.plot(kind='line', marker='o')
```

Recent trends show increasing usage of sliders and sweepers across MLB.

### 4. Machine Learning Features

Use arsenal metrics as features for pitcher performance prediction:

```python
# Calculate pitch diversity
df['pitch_diversity'] = (df[[col for col in df.columns if 'usage_pct' in col]] > 5).sum(axis=1)
```

## Data Collection Method

The data collection notebook is also available for reproducing the dataset with updated seasons:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasunorim/mlb-pitcher-arsenal-2020-2025?select=pitcher_arsenal_evolution_2020_2025.ipynb

### Collection Process

```python
from pybaseball import statcast_pitcher
import pandas as pd

# Example: Collect arsenal data for a pitcher
pitcher_id = 660271  # Shohei Ohtani
season = 2025

# Get pitch-by-pitch data
df = statcast_pitcher(
    start_dt=f"{season}-03-01",
    end_dt=f"{season}-11-30",
    player_id=pitcher_id
)

# Aggregate by pitch type
arsenal = df.groupby('pitch_type').agg({
    'release_speed': 'mean',
    'release_spin_rate': 'mean',
    'pfx_x': 'mean',
    'pfx_z': 'mean',
    'pitch_type': 'count'
})
```
