## Introduction

I've published a Kaggle dataset containing Statcast data for Japanese MLB players from 2015 to 2025. This dataset provides pitch-by-pitch and batted ball data for analyzing performance trends of Japanese players in Major League Baseball.

**Dataset Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasunorim/japan-mlb-pitchers-batters-statcast

## Dataset Overview

**Japan MLB Pitchers Batters Statcast (2015-2025)**

- **Pitching Data**: 25 pitchers, 118,226 pitches (65MB)
- **Batting Data**: 10 batters, 56,362 batted balls (31MB)
- **Player Metadata**: 34 players
- **Period**: 2015-2025 (since Statcast introduction)
- **Quality Score**: 10.0/10 on Kaggle

## Data Collection Process

### 1. Getting Player IDs with pybaseball

First, retrieve the MLBAM ID for each player:

```python
from pybaseball import playerid_lookup

# Search by player name
player = playerid_lookup("ohtani", "shohei")
print(player)
# key_mlbam column contains MLBAM ID (660271)
```

### 2. Fetching Statcast Data

Use the MLBAM ID to retrieve pitch-by-pitch data:

```python
from pybaseball import statcast_pitcher, statcast_batter

# Pitcher data
df_pitching = statcast_pitcher(
    start_dt="2015-03-01",
    end_dt="2025-02-08",
    player_id=660271  # Shohei Ohtani
)

# Batter data
df_batting = statcast_batter(
    start_dt="2015-03-01",
    end_dt="2025-02-08",
    player_id=660271  # Shohei Ohtani
)
```

### 3. Combining Multiple Players

Concatenate data from all players:

```python
import pandas as pd

pitcher_ids = [660271, 506433, 808967, ...]  # All pitcher IDs
batting_ids = [660271, 673548, 807799, ...]  # All batter IDs

# Pitching data
pitching_dfs = []
for pid in pitcher_ids:
    df = statcast_pitcher("2015-03-01", "2025-02-08", pid)
    pitching_dfs.append(df)
df_all_pitching = pd.concat(pitching_dfs, ignore_index=True)

# Batting data
batting_dfs = []
for bid in batting_ids:
    df = statcast_batter("2015-03-01", "2025-02-08", bid)
    batting_dfs.append(df)
df_all_batting = pd.concat(batting_dfs, ignore_index=True)
```

## Usage in Kaggle Notebooks

### 1. Add Dataset to kernel-metadata.json

```json
{
  "id": "your-username/your-notebook-slug",
  "title": "Your Notebook Title",
  "code_file": "your-notebook.ipynb",
  "language": "python",
  "kernel_type": "notebook",
  "is_private": "false",
  "enable_gpu": "false",
  "enable_tpu": "false",
  "enable_internet": "false",
  "dataset_sources": ["yasunorim/japan-mlb-pitchers-batters-statcast"],
  "competition_sources": [],
  "kernel_sources": [],
  "model_sources": []
}
```

### 2. Load Data in Notebook

```python
import pandas as pd

# Pitching data
df_pitching = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/japan-mlb-pitchers-batters-statcast/japanese_mlb_pitching.csv')

# Batting data
df_batting = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/japan-mlb-pitchers-batters-statcast/japanese_mlb_batting.csv')

# Player metadata
df_players = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/japan-mlb-pitchers-batters-statcast/players.csv')

print(f'Pitching data: {len(df_pitching)} records')
print(f'Batting data: {len(df_batting)} records')
```

## Analysis Examples

### SQL Queries with DuckDB

```python
import pandas as pd
import duckdb

df = pd.read_csv("japanese_mlb_pitching.csv")
con = duckdb.connect()

# Yu Darvish (MLBAM ID: 506433) regular season data
df_darvish = con.execute("""
    SELECT game_year, pitch_type, COUNT(*) as count,
           AVG(release_speed) as avg_speed,
           AVG(release_spin_rate) as avg_spin
    FROM df
    WHERE pitcher = 506433 AND game_type = 'R'
    GROUP BY game_year, pitch_type
    ORDER BY game_year, count DESC
""").df()
```

### Batted Ball Visualization

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df_batting = pd.read_csv("japanese_mlb_batting.csv")
df_ohtani = df_batting[df_batting["batter"] == 660271]

plt.scatter(df_ohtani["launch_angle"], df_ohtani["launch_speed"], alpha=0.5)
plt.xlabel("Launch Angle (degrees)")
plt.ylabel("Launch Speed (mph)")
plt.title("Batted Ball Profile - Shohei Ohtani")
plt.show()
```
